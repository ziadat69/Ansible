1) Ad-Hoc Commands: Install Ansible, configure the hosts file, display Yum repository lists, install OpenSSH, manage OpenSSH with the Yum module (install or remove), create files with specific permissions, and delete created files.

2) Playbooks: Create and delete a file with specific permissions, organize and execute multiple playbooks within a main playbook, create groups and add users, and import these playbooks within a main playbook.

 3) Handlers: Install and start services like Apache using handlers, create playbooks with handlers that continue on error and execute multiple tasks.
    
 4) Roles: Create structured tasks for specific purposes such as managing files, users, and server configurations; define handlers within roles to perform additional actions when notified.
