2. ==> vim /etc/ansible/host       
        [ all]

___________________________________________________________
To list all the modules available in Ansible, you can use the following command:
 
--> ansible-doc -l 


1 ==> ansible   all -m command -a  " yum install openssh"   
  ==> ansible all -m shell -a "sudo yum install openssh"  
  shell vs command : If you are running simple commands, use the command module. If you need to run complex commands that require Shell features (loops, redirection, etc.), use the shell module.

2  ==> ansible   all  -m yum -a  “ name= openssh state=present  “  or  ansible   all  -m yum -a  “ name= openssh state=absent  “

3 ==> ansible   all  -I  Ip,  -m file  -a  “ path=/file1 state= touch mode=777“ 

4. 3 ==> ansible   all  -I  Ip,  -m file  -a  “ path=/file1 state= absent“ 

****************************************
If the file /etc/ansible/hosts does not exist, 
you can create a local configuration file ansible.cfg to define the inventory and other settings for Ansible. 
Follow these steps:

--> vim ansible.cfg
    Add the following lines to define the inventory:

     [defaults]
     inventory = ./hosts

2. Create the hosts file
This file will contain the group definitions and server details.

vim hosts
Add the following content to define two groups:

Content of the hosts file:

[redteam]
redserver ansible_host=172.16.232.142 ansible_user=glitch

[blueteam]
blueserver ansible_host=172.16.232.142 ansible_user=ahmad
