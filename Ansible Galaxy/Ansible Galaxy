1. Download a Role from Ansible Galaxy:

You can use pre-built roles from Ansible Galaxy, such as setting up Apache or Nginx. To download the Apache role, run the following command:

ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache

This command will download the Apache role developed by geerlingguy to your roles/ directory.

2. Create a playbook.yml File:

Create a playbook.yml file to use the downloaded Apache role.

---
- hosts: localhost
  become: yes

  roles:
    - geerlingguy.apache

3. Set Up a hosts File:

Create a hosts file to define your target servers. If youâ€™re running the test locally, you can use the localhost configuration.

[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local

4. Run the Test:

To run the playbook you created and apply the Apache role on your local machine, use the following command:

ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml

5. Verify the Test:

After the playbook runs successfully, you can verify that Apache has been installed and is running. Open http://localhost in your web browser, or use the following command to check the status of the Apache service:

systemctl status apache2

Result:

If everything is set up correctly, Apache should be installed and running on your machine. This means you have successfully tested a role downloaded from Ansible Galaxy.
