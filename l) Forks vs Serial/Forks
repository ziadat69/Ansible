-->>>1. Forks (Parallelism) Example:


Imagine you're organizing a big conference and you need to set up chairs in a large hall. You have 4 workers, and each worker can set up 5 chairs at a time.

Forks Example:
You set the Forks to 5, which means each worker can handle 5 chairs simultaneously. All 4 workers can work at the same time, so in total, 20 chairs are set up in parallel, speeding up the process.
In Ansible:
You have 20 servers, and you set forks = 5 to run 5 tasks in parallel at a time.
Command example:

ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml -f 5
This runs the tasks on 5 machines in parallel.
