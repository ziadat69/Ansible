Serial (Sequential) Example:
Now, imagine you are running a workshop where you want to train participants in batches. You have 10 participants, but you prefer to train only 2 participants at a time.

Serial Example:
You set the Serial to 2, which means only 2 participants will receive training at a time. Once the first 2 finish, the next 2 will start, and so on, until all 10 participants are trained. This approach ensures that each batch gets focused attention.
In Ansible:
You have 10 servers, and you want to update them in batches of 2.

- name: Update servers in batches of 2
  hosts: all
  serial: 2
  tasks:
    - name: Install updates
      yum:
        name: "*"
        state: latest

This means Ansible will update 2 servers at a time.
